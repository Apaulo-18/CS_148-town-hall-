			<h1>The Santa Susana Mountains</h1>
			<img src="../images/santa_susana.jpg" alt="santa_susana_mountains">
				<p>The Santa Susana Mountains are a transverse range of mountains in Southern California, north of the city of Los Angeles, 
					in the United States. The range runs east-west, separating the San Fernando and Simi valleys on its south from the Santa 
					Clara River Valley to the north and the Santa Clarita Valley to the northeast. The Oxnard Plain is to the west of the 
					Santa Susana Mountains.</p><br> 
				<p><b>Notable landmarks:</b> The Old Santa Susana Stage Road, or Santa Susana Wagon Road, is a route taken by early travelers 
					between the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley near Chatsworth, California, via the Santa Susana Pass. It was an 
					important artery linking the Los Angeles Basin and inland Ventura County and as such, was part of the main route for 
					travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities
					in 1876. The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
