        	<h1>The San Gabriel Mountains</h1>
				<img src="../images/san_gabriel.jpg" alt="san-gabriel-mountains">	
				<p>The San Gabriel Mountains comprise a mountain range located in northern Los Angeles County 
					and western San Bernardino County, California, United States. The mountain range is part of the Transverse Ranges and 
					lies between the Los Angeles Basin and the Mojave Desert, with Interstate 5 to the west and Interstate 15 to the east. 
					The range lies in, and is surrounded by, the Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests, with the San Andreas Fault as 
					its northern border.</p><br>

				<p><b>Notable landmarks:</b> The Cold War, between the Communist World (the Soviet Union and its allies) and the Western World (the United States and its allies), lasted from 1946 to 1991. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989. During this period of political, military and economic conflict, various strategies were undertaken by the United States to defend against a nuclear attack delivered by aircraft. Nike Missile bases were the last line of defense in a chain that included sea and land based aircraft. Nike sites were initially armed in 1953 with Nike Ajax missiles. Project Nike began 1944 when the War Department demanded a new air defense system to combat new jet aircraft, as existing gun-based systems proved largely incapable of dealing with the speeds and altitudes at which jet aircraft operated. Bell Laboratories offered Project Nike which would have to deal with bombers flying at 500 mph (800 km/h) or more, at altitudes of up to 60,000 ft (20,000 m). The Nike air defense systems remained prominent until 1965 when the USSR ICBMs started rendering them less effective and they started being decommissioned. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed during 1972, and further budget reduction, almost all Nike sites in the continental United States were deactivated by April 1974.
					The LA area was home to 24 Nike air defense sites.<br>
					 There were 4 in the San Fernando Valley with remnants of 2 still visitable, LA-88 in Chatsworth and LA-94 in Sylmar. There is also LA-96 Santa Monica which has been turned into a LA historical landmark.
